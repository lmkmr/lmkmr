# Lucky begins to monolog...
Hey... I'm Lucky, ironic isn't it? How twisted my effed up life is, like a Japanese Anime...

*\*I hold my hand up and splay my fingers, covering part of my face.\**

You ever heard of Tokyo Ghoul?

When I'm not hacking circles around the likes of Microsoft or Facebook I practice with my Katana (Japanese for sword) it's sharper than anything ever produced by man, except of course my own disciplined mind. A mind sharper than a blade is only as strong as the weapon its body wields. Your gun is no match for my blade. I can cut through 100 speeding bullets.

You never answered my question about Tokyo Ghoul by the way. It's fine.

My favorite color is Akai (Japanese for red) because I am not shy to bloodshed and my favorite food is Ramen.

*\*I adjust the gold chain and durag I've been wearing the entire time.\**
